For my last project blog post, I sort of just went through the technical thought process and workflow of everthing I did. This time I'll start off with some of my personal anecdotes and ideas.

The inspiration for this project comes from my constant facsination with incremental games. I'm sure many of us has played such games in one form or another, since many of the most popular mobile games hinge on core concept of incremental progress. 

The first time I became interested with this style of game was with [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/), a web browser game that was very simple: Each time you click a cookie on the screen you get a cookie. While you accumulate cookies, you can use them to purchase ways to gain more cookies, and ultimately your goal to get as many cookies as fast as possible. What amazed me about this game was how engrossed you can get so quickly off such a simple concept. While the game surged in popularity for a brief period of time, it quickly died down and people just forgot about it eventually. However, I was definitely captivated by how good it felt to watch the number of cookies go up, along with upgrades, strategy and more. This was what piqued my interest.

I played some other similar incremental games both online and mobile pretty casually over the years and have realized some commonalities that are super interesting. Some of the most satisfying moments are when you are moving at a steady pace and then suddenly rewarded with a burst of currency (cookies, clicks, or any sort of reward), or when you're normally progressing and you get surprised with some that's free. These rewards systems definitely cater to a part of our human nature and that's why I believe that a lot of what makes these games fun and engaging can be augmented on to modern apps or services to make them better. There are already apps like [Habitica](https://habitica.com/static/front), which gamify habits and todo lists to give people extra motivaton, but I believe that this is just the beginning and that there are far more successfui ideas that can be based on the incremental rewards concept.

With all that in mind, my sinatra app is just a very basic shell of a potential implementation. Users can login into an account and click a button that increments their 'click'  total. The more they click, the more 'clicks' they accumalte, which can then be used to purchase rewards. In the future, what 'clicks' are (money, points, etc) and how they are accumated can be altered, along with what the rewards are. This app is a basic model what I want to make in the future and will hopefully act as a foundation for intuition and experience.
