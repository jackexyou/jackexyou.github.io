I'm not much of a writer so I'll get straight to the point. I like the concept of version control and git. It lets multiple people collaborate and work on the same project with minimal disruptions in workflow and really organizes everyone's contributions in a logical manner. Using and learing about git was definitely the first time I've been exposed to this kind of organization, since a lot of what was taught in school was very linear.

Because of how unique version control feels to me, I was just thinking about how it can be used for organizing my ideas. When I have ideas, it's a real mess sometimes so it easy for me to lose track of them. I have those eureka moments once in a while but if don't write down or record it somewhere it's usually lost within a couple days . If I could just save "repos" of my ideas, be able to commit changes, merge branches, etc, it would make idea generation and keeping track of my good ideas a lot more robust.

I think a good example of this would be just coming up with an app idea. Even before you implement the features you can just go through the "versions" of your ideas first. Writing down what you you want to implement, what you like, going through newer versions by tweaking your idea when new variables come in. But I don't think it stops there, I'm trying to extend that to fields outside of programming and maybe even to our everyday lives.

So a further example would be like I'm going on a trip. I have a list of things I want to do so I'll list that down first. That's the intitial version of my idea. Then I could add the places, activities, and plan into far more nuanced details of my trip because I've organized my ideas in a way that allows. An added benefit I think is also the ability to look at the evolution of your ideas and how they grow or mature, giving you a better understanding of the process you go through when coming up or adding to ideas. 

Lastly I think one of the best things with an implementation of idea version control is the ability to easily share your ideas with people in a very organized manner. I know very well from personal experience that explain new ideas to people can be a difficult task, but what if the cool idea you came up with was already well documented and shows the full change log of how you got there? People can contribute to your ideas which lets you have a different perspective on things you might not usually have one for.

All in all I think that programming can sort of be abstracted into being the way we implement our ideas into everyday life, and since version control is such a powerful tool, why not abstract it one level higher into just controlling our ideas themselves?
