This is my first blog post and the title may seem very obvious to those of us at Flatiron, but I think it bears repeating. Technology is so ubiquitous nowadays that we often take it for granted. So much of our everyday lives have fully integrated with some form of technology that we simply cannot live without it. In this day and age I think that it is absolutely essential for everyone to have at least a barebone understanding of technology, whether that's being able to use a computer or knowing your way around a smartphone. But why stop there? If techonology is truly the future, then we should spend a good portion of our time trying to fully understand it. Learning the fundamental processes and programming languages that define our technology means that we are in more control of our lives: We gain the ability to pick and choose what we use, we're able to understand the benefits and consequences of certain types of tech, and we have the ability to fix things that we otherwise wouldn't. 

It is this sentiment that drives me to learn more about technology and programming. I have faith that investing my time in learning programming will equate to an investment to my future.
